													REINFORCEMENT LEARNING DEMO

This is a short demo of two different reinforcement learning algorithms in a
simple maze world.  The red squares give negative reward (-1) and the green
squares give positive reward (+3).  The goal of the agents is to find an optimal
policy.  The left grid shows a Q-learning agent and the right shows a
SARSA-lambda agent.  This demo was put together for a short presentation I did
on reinforcement learning.

BUILDING

There is a SConstruct file so this can be built using Scons.  If you have Scons
installed, simply type 

scons

This demo requires boost libraries, SDL, and OpenGL be installed.  


RUNNING

Simply execute the rl_demo file after building.


BUGS

I am aware of none, though I have only tested this on a couple of machines, all
with Ubuntu 10.10 as the OS.  If you find bugs, let me know.  There are many
additional features that could be added, and certainly improvements can be made.
I wrote this as a simple demo for a single presentation, but have published it
in the hopes that someone else might find it useful.  If you do, or have
suggestions for improvements, let me know.
